SearchJack
==========

Project for intelligently seraching the tuning space in Jackhammer

TO CUSTOMIZE:
within src/runTrialFunctions.py modify two functions 
- runTest
- enumerateSearchSpace
Right now these both return random data, but need to be modified to return the data types indicated. 

TO RUN:
from within src/ run
"python runTrial_unifRandMexhaustiveB-rep1.py"
produces a pickle datafile within directory.
